## My information
<p>My name is Duy Khanh, I am a 2nd year student at university.<p>
<p>I love watching anime - Japanese cartoons, as well as manga and light novels.<p>
<p>I love to eat food and drink chocolate-related drinks.<p>
<p>Regarding programming, I got used to programming very early, when I was a student in middle school. I am familiar with programming in the Pascal language. I thought it was quite interesting and it drew me to a certain amount of time before coming into contact with other new languages.<p>
